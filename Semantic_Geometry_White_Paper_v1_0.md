# Semantic Geometry: Mapping Concepts Through Variables in a New Mathematical Framework

**White Paper v1.0.0** - **Author:** Rogério Figurelli - **Date:** 2025-05-15

## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces the concept of a Semantic Geometry Dictionary (SGD), a structured system that encodes abstract concepts into mathematical formulas using variable-driven frameworks. The goal is to enable interpretability, causal reasoning, and simulation of meaning within AI systems, decision-making tools, educational environments, and conceptual modeling.

In contrast to black-box neural networks, the SGD offers a transparent, symbolic approach that reflects how abstract terms like "wisdom," "flow," or "unification" are constructed, influenced, and modified by their components. Each concept is defined by 2, 3, or more variables, each marked with a "(+)" or "(-)" to indicate positive or negative influence, and is accompanied by a canonical equation that represents the concept in its operational form.

The dictionary allows for a variable number of dimensions per concept. Some require just two dimensions for operational clarity (e.g., trust = consistency / volatility), while others demand richer, multidimensional representations. This flexibility supports different levels of modeling depth and semantic granularity.

By linking concepts to functional equations, the SGD enables practical use in interpretable AI and conceptual modeling—bridging theoretical insight and application \[1], \[3]—in applications such as interpretable AI, ethical simulations, educational modeling, philosophical reasoning, and value-driven system design. It allows human language to be formalized without reducing its expressive richness.

This system also supports real-time diagnostics, intervention design, and explanation generation. Instead of vague references to "alignment" or "purpose," systems powered by the SGD can refer to the precise mathematical structures driving those qualities.

Ultimately, the Semantic-Mathematical Dictionary aims to provide an extensible conceptual infrastructure for computational reasoning, narrative design, institutional modeling, and educational synthesis. It is not a replacement for natural language but a bridge between human understanding and formal expression.

## 1  Introduction

Human language excels in abstraction but often lacks operational clarity. Words like "wisdom," "justice," or "trust" carry enormous semantic weight but are hard to translate directly into decision-making logic, simulations, or AI models. We propose a structured dictionary that maps such concepts into explicit mathematical forms.

Each concept is modeled by a canonical equation using a minimal but meaningful set of variables. These variables represent psychologically or socially grounded traits or forces and are tagged with "+" (positive influence) or "-" (negative influence)." (negative influence). The result is an actionable, computable representation of meaning.

Instead of treating concepts as static definitions, the Semantic-Mathematical Dictionary treats them as dynamic systems, echoing the cognitive pluralism of \[8] and the dynamic processing model of \[4]. Their value at a given time depends on the interaction of variables. For example, wisdom may be seen as the product of intelligence and consciousness, while flow may depend on attention, immersion, and feedback.

This structure opens new possibilities for machine reasoning, education, cultural comparison, and simulation. With precise formalization, abstract ideas can become operational modules in software, curricula, strategic planning, and policy evaluation.

By allowing different numbers of variables (2, 3, 4, or more), the system accommodates conceptual complexity without imposing arbitrary uniformity. Simpler ideas require fewer components; others, like resilience or ethics, may involve rich structures.

Moreover, by enforcing the presence of a canonical equation per concept, the system ensures that all semantic items can be reused in higher-level compositions, comparative analysis, or hybrid AI architectures.

## 2  Problem Statement

Despite advances in AI, abstract concepts remain largely inaccessible to systems—a limitation observed in both language models and cognitive science literature \[6], \[7]. Current LLMs operate through language patterns, not formal semantics. They can define a term like "courage," but they cannot simulate its interaction with fear or duty in a mathematically grounded way.

This limits their utility in areas requiring causal modeling, ethical reasoning, policy simulation, or educational intervention design. Even human experts struggle to agree on what abstract concepts mean operationally.

Moreover, black-box AI models are difficult to interpret. Their decisions may align with human values—or not—but the internal logic remains opaque. Without structural models of abstract concepts, we lack tools for explaining or debugging AI decisions.

Finally, existing ontologies and semantic networks are descriptive, not functional. They map terms but not equations. They show connections but not the dynamics that generate meaning.

## 3  Proposed Solutions

The Semantic Geometry Dictionary (SGD) is envisioned as the structural output of the modeling framework proposed in \[1]. That system provides an arena-based mechanism for exploring, testing, and validating equations that define abstract concepts based on variable simulation across diverse cognitive profiles. Each entry in the SGD emerges from that method, ensuring empirical grounding.

Unlike static lexicons, the SGD is built dynamically from validated equation-based definitions. Each concept is modeled with multiple variables—2, 3, or more—depending on its semantic complexity. Variables are selected based on their explanatory power, profile discrimination, and alignment with concept semantics.

Crucially, every variable carries a direction tag: +(positive driver) or -(negative force), making each formula causally interpretable and simulation-ready. For example:

*Harmony* is modeled as:
`Harmony = QE / (1 + Entropy)`
Where:

* QE (+): internal coherence
* Entropy (-): contextual noise

This shows that harmony can be improved by increasing QE or reducing entropy. These dynamics can be actively tested and visualized.

*Wisdom* is modeled as:
`Wisdom = Intelligence ^ Consciousness`
Where:

* Intelligence (+): cognitive capacity
* Consciousness (+): reflective awareness

Here, the exponential relationship highlights how even modest improvements in consciousness yield nonlinear gains in wisdom.

The equations stored in the SGD can be manually designed or *inferred* through the automated system in \[1], where formulas compete in thousands of simulated rounds, and only those surpassing a statistical threshold are accepted. This creates a data-grounded, evolution-friendly dictionary of meaning.

By including both manually proposed and automatically inferred formulas, the SGD serves as a hybrid structure—part symbolic model, part empirical engine.

This makes it ideal for AI systems that require both grounding and generativity. For instance, a concept like *Resilience* might emerge with a formula like:
`Resilience = (Adaptability * Stability) / Stress`
Where:

* Adaptability (+): flexibility in response
* Stability (+): baseline resistance to change
* Stress (-): environmental or internal pressures

Such definitions can then be reused as components within higher-order constructs like *Integrity* or *Wisdom*, enabling modular compositional modeling of complex human traits.

The Semantic Geometry Dictionary (SGD) is designed to be constructed using the methodology introduced in \[1], which enables the modeling of abstract human concepts through controlled simulation environments. This system generates and tests equations by running thousands of competitive rounds in what is termed an "equation arena," allowing the most discriminative, interpretable, and structurally sound formulas to emerge.

Each entry in the SGD includes a concept modeled by an equation derived from either manual formulation or from this inferential system. The dictionary is dynamic and accepts equations with varying numbers of variables depending on the conceptual complexity—ranging from binary models (e.g., `Trust = Consistency / Volatility`) to high-dimensional systems such as:

`Resilience = (Stability * Purpose * Adaptability) / Stress`

* Stability (+): baseline resistance to change
* Purpose (+): alignment with long-term goals
* Adaptability (+): flexibility in response
* Stress (-): environmental or internal pressures

Here, resilience rises with inner strength and flexibility, but is suppressed by stress—a formulation that not only explains the concept but enables intervention modeling.

Inferable equations are fully valid entries in the SGD and can be used across applications. For example, a curriculum engine might track a student's development in flow (`Flow = Attention * Immersion + Feedback`) or wisdom (`Wisdom = Intelligence ^ Consciousness`) and adjust learning stimuli accordingly.

The use of multiple variables per concept—with explicitly tagged roles (+V/-V)—is a core feature of the SGD. This allows it to capture nuance that static taxonomies cannot. For instance, modifying `Harmony = QE / (1 + Entropy)` shows how even a slight increase in entropy can reduce harmony, enabling dynamic prediction.

Ultimately, every equation in the SGD is a semantic object: reusable, testable, and interpretable. This makes the dictionary not just a reference, but an engine of simulation, analysis, and structural reasoning.

To illustrate how concepts are modeled, consider the following examples:

*Wisdom* is defined as:
`Wisdom = Intelligence ^ Consciousness`
Where:

* Intelligence (+): cognitive capacity and abstraction
* Consciousness (+): self-awareness and reflective depth
  Increasing either variable causes wisdom to grow exponentially, making this a highly sensitive concept.

*Flow* is defined as:
`Flow = (Attention * Immersion) + Feedback`
Where:

* Attention (+): mental stability and focus
* Immersion (+): depth of engagement in the moment
* Feedback (+): real-time input that guides and adjusts the state
  Flow increases with deeper presence and tighter feedback loops.

*Harmony* is defined as:
`Harmony = QE / (1 + Disorder)`
Where:

* QE (+): internal qualitative coherence
* Disorder (-): contextual friction or misalignment
  Here, harmony grows with inner coherence but is diminished by external turbulence.

*Trust* can be represented by:
`Trust = Consistency / Volatility`
Where:

* Consistency (+): repeatability of behavior over time
* Volatility (-): unpredictability or instability in signals
  Trust increases when consistency rises and volatility is minimized.

Each of these examples demonstrates how the Semantic Geometry Dictionary transforms abstract meaning into usable, explainable systems.

The Semantic Geometry Dictionary (SGD) addresses these issues by defining abstract concepts through mathematical formulas \[3], \[4] built from interpretable variables. built from interpretable variables. Each formula contains a variable number of components based on conceptual depth.

For example, *wisdom* may be modeled as:
`Wisdom = Intelligence ^ Consciousness`, where both sub-concepts are variables in their own right.

Each variable is tagged as "+V" (a positive driver of the concept) or "-V" (a force that undermines it). This directional clarity enables real-time diagnostics and intervention modeling. For example, increasing feedback responsiveness improves flow, while increasing contextual disorder reduces harmony.

The SGD includes canonical equations for every concept, allowing them to be reused in nested systems. For instance, "trust" might be used inside a larger model for "social cohesion."

Unlike neural nets, these models are human-readable, structurally coherent, and explainable. They offer a causal understanding of meaning.

The number of variables per concept is flexible. Some ideas stabilize with 2 inputs; others require 4 or more to capture multidimensional structure.

The SGD can power educational platforms that show how values interrelate, simulate what affects dignity or justice, or compare how different cultures weigh different drivers of the same idea.

This structure is especially suited to philosophical modeling, psychological assessment, organizational design, and hybrid symbolic-AI systems.

It also supports the creation of domain-specific dictionaries—for ethics, governance, character modeling, or team dynamics.

The SGD becomes an engine not just for interpretation, but for simulation, analysis, and design.

## 4  Core Principles

Before articulating the core principles of the Semantic Geometry Dictionary (SGD), it is important to clarify their role. These principles define the design constraints and theoretical commitments that make the SGD not only structurally rigorous but also operationally valuable. Each principle is oriented toward interpretability, traceability, and reuse in both computational and human-centered environments.

**Interpretability**: Every formula must be readable, human-explainable, and symbolically traceable. The structure of the SGD allows any system or user to audit how a concept is built, why a decision is made, or how a shift in one variable propagates through a model.

**Causal Semantics**: Variables have defined directions of impact (+ or -), enabling structured influence modeling. This provides the foundation for simulation, diagnostics, and reasoning: for example, increasing entropy always reduces harmony, while increased coherence drives it upward.

**Flexible Dimensionality**: Concepts can have 2, 3, or more variables depending on complexity. Simple models such as `Trust = Consistency / Volatility` require minimal inputs, while more nuanced ideas like `Resilience = (Adaptability * Stability * Purpose) / Stress` demonstrate how richer models enable finer-grained reasoning.

**Reusability and Modularity**: Each formula can serve as a module in larger conceptual systems. For example, `Trust`, `Flow`, and `Wisdom` can each be reused as variables in a higher-level concept such as `Leadership`. This supports symbolic compositionality across domains, enabling structured cognitive modeling and explainable AI.

These principles also enhance model transparency when compared with black-box LLMs. Where language models operate probabilistically, the SGD offers a structural alternative: formulas whose variables have defined roles, causality, and scope. Because the SGD is grounded in both human-understandable meaning and operational function, its models are naturally interpretable.

The SGD is designed to support a growing network of such formulas, generated through the arena system introduced in \[1]. As concepts evolve or are adapted to different cultures or systems, their formulas can be re-evaluated and updated while maintaining internal consistency. This allows the SGD to function not only as a dictionary, but as a *semantic operating system* across educational, technical, and human-facing applications.

## 5  Comparative Analysis

Interpretability and explainability are critical differentiators of the Semantic Geometry Dictionary (SGD) when compared to traditional large language models (LLMs). SGD makes explicit what LLMs leave implicit: the structure of abstract meaning. Every concept modeled in the SGD has a transparent mathematical form, making it explainable by design.

While LLMs often provide post hoc explanations that may or may not reflect the actual generative process, the SGD offers structural accountability. Each decision or outcome can be traced back to an equation and variable set, such as `Trust = Consistency / Volatility`. If volatility increases, trust decreases. The reasoning is not inferred—it is built-in.

This interpretability becomes especially valuable in applications requiring ethical or regulatory oversight. In AI-assisted governance, for example, justifying a policy recommendation using `Justice = Equity * Transparency - Corruption` provides both clarity and auditability. LLMs may suggest a similar outcome, but without the capacity to deconstruct or simulate its drivers.

In decision support systems, the SGD enables systems to state exactly why a path was chosen: "This decision scored highest based on the formula for Harmony because it increased coherence while minimizing entropy." LLMs cannot provide this level of symbolic traceability without external scaffolding.

Moreover, because every variable in the SGD has a directional influence (+V or -V), interpretability extends beyond static formulas. Analysts can simulate counterfactuals: "What happens to wisdom if consciousness drops by 20%?" The equation tells you. LLMs, while generative, lack such precision.

When compared with LLMs, the SGD provides advantages in symbolic clarity, causal reasoning, and structural alignment.

While LLMs generate fluent language and plausible reasoning, they lack internal compositional semantics. SGDs encode meaning into formulas, enabling simulation and measurement. For instance, while an LLM might describe wisdom as "a combination of knowledge and experience," the SGD represents it precisely as `Wisdom = Intelligence ^ Consciousness`. This allows a model to simulate the effect of increasing intelligence by 10% or decreasing consciousness under stress.

Unlike static ontologies, the SGD defines not just relationships, but functions. It shows not only that "trust" relates to "coherence," but that `Trust = Consistency / Volatility`, quantifying how volatility undermines trust in decision systems. This enables real-time diagnostic tools in governance simulations.

In contrast to probabilistic embeddings, SGDs offer compositional expressiveness. For example, in educational software, flow states can be modeled as `Flow = (Attention * Immersion) + Feedback`, and adjusted dynamically based on user behavior—something LLMs can't simulate without task-specific tuning.

In ethics modeling, LLMs generate good heuristics, like "justice is fairness." But the SGD enables structured trade-offs: `Justice = Equity * Transparency - Corruption`, allowing policy simulations with quantifiable levers. LLMs could describe the change; SGD models it.

In education, LLMs answer questions. SGDs can show what happens if we increase reflection or decrease feedback in a learner model. For example, modifying `Wisdom = Intelligence ^ Consciousness` with reduced consciousness (e.g., distraction) would show a sharp drop in wisdom score—guiding pedagogical design.

In decision support systems, LLMs can generate explanations. SGDs can justify outcomes via math: "This course of action ranked highest because it maximized cohesion while minimizing entropy, per the formula for Harmony."

Moreover, LLMs often require extensive prompting to handle abstract language properly. The SGD provides a structural scaffold: if a system knows what variables define "resilience" or "empathy," it can generate far more accurate and explainable content.

SGDs are also modular. If trust is a component of social cohesion, it can be embedded directly, unlike LLMs, which rely on implicit pattern recognition. This makes SGD ideal for designing interpretable agent behaviors.

Combined, the two paradigms are synergistic: LLMs generate, contextualize, and explain; SGDs simulate, evaluate, and design.

This synergy enables the construction of hybrid systems that combine narrative flexibility with structural accountability. For example, an LLM can generate possible responses to a user query about leadership, while the SGD can score these responses according to the equation for trust, integrity, or coherence. Together, they support AI systems that are not only expressive but grounded in transparent meaning structures.
